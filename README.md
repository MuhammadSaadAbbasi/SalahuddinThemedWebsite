## 💡 What is This?

While scrolling through the web, I saw a Spider-Man themed site. That sparked an idea — why not build something inspired by our own historical heroes?

So, I created a themed website to honor **Salahuddin Ayyubi**, not just to showcase code skills, but to revive an era of valor, ethics, and elegance — all through design.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I don’t enjoy step-by-step tutorials. I learn best by **building**, making mistakes, and understanding concepts as I go. This site helped me explore:

- Layout techniques like Grid and Flex
- Visual storytelling through CSS
- Clean UI and subtle animations
- How to make things responsive without a CSS framework

And more importantly — **how to enjoy the journey**.
